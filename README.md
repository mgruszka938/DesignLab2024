## Timeline
- We've spent first couple of weeks on acquring knowledge about stepper motors.
- Then we focused on assembling our circuit, which was a bit challenging, because of lack of the power supply. Fortunately we found one (from an old router).
- Another task that we focused most of our time on was writing a functioning program that will properly move our stepper motor.
- We added appropriate functionality to enable UART communication.
- We added multiple move functions that we thought would be suitable for the darkbox environment.
- We plan on adding further components and functions if needed.
