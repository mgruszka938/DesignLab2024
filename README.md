# Stepper Motor Laser Aim
## Necessary equipment
- Arduino Uno Rev3
- stepper motor NEMA 17 (bipolar)
- driver module A4988
- 12V power supply
## Usage
Commands supported:
```
MOVE LEFT <steps>
MOVE RIGHT <steps>
RESET
POSITION
```
## Timeline
- We've spent first couple of weeks on acquring knowledge about stepper motors.
- Then we focused on assembling our circuit, which was a bit challenging, because of lack of the power supply. Fortunately we found one (from an old router).
- Another task that we focused most of our time on was writing a functioning program that will properly move our stepper motor.
- We added appropriate functionality to enable UART communication.
- We plan on adding further components and functions if needed.
