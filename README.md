# Stepper Motor Laser Aim
## Necessary equipment
- Arduino Uno Rev3
- stepper motor NEMA 17 (bipolar)
- driver module A4988
- 12V power supply
## Timeline
- We've spent first couple of weeks on acquring knowledge about stepper motors.
- Then we focused on assembling our circuit, which was a bit challenging, because of lack of the power supply. Fortunately we found one, from an old router.
